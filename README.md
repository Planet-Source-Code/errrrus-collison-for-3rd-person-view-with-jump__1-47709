### Description

I hope u can use this. I took this out directly from my game.

I took alot of stuff that u don't need out. For example Automated Mesh loading.

You are free to use any of this code but if u use the camera code plz

at least tell me.

All of the collision Code are in the Actor_Mod module.

The sub WalkoverMesh in that module makes the actor walk on the wall.

Add when ever he presses left or right the sub Actor_Pressed_Up gets activated.

And There it checks all the collision and thats kinda it.

If u have any question or suggestion email me.
