3rd Person Collision Detection (Mesh Collision)  with Jump

I hope u can use this. I took this out directly from my game.
I took alot of stuff that u don't need out. For example Automated Mesh loading.
You are free to use any of this code but if u use the camera code plz
at least tell me.

All of the collision Code are in the Actor_Mod module.
The sub WalkoverMesh in that module makes the actor walk on the wall.
ANd when ever he presses left or right the sub Actor_Pressed_Up gets activated.
And There it checks all the collision and thats kinda it.
If u have any question or suggestion email me.
